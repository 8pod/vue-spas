# Vue.js
## Adding Modules 
> > Author Notes: 
The Vue CLI gives you a great starting point, but in any project, you'll want to install additional modules because we'll, we're not all the same. 

I'm assuming you're a bit familiar creating web projects, and have done some installations before.

# What you'll install

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk)
- [VueFire](https://vuefire.vuejs.org/)
- [Install Gist](https://gist.github.com/planetoftheweb/c32e93908518eb77dc413ff8f1295d71/edit)

> > Author Notes: 

The package.json file is where all of our installations live on a node project. This file controls what is in our node_modules folder. which has all of the modules...those are like extensions that our project needs.

I've created a special gist to save you some typing.

Now that we've installed our supplemental modules we're ready to start customizing our application.
